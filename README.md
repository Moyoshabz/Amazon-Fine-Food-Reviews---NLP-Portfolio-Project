# Amazon Fine Food Reviews

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights from food product reviews posted on Amazon. It's built using Python, Pandas, NLTK/SpaCy, and Matplotlib, and is designed as a showcase portfolio project.

## Project Goals:

- Clean and preprocess real-world customer review data
- Tokenize text data for further analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize word frequencies with WordCloud
- Conduct sentiment analysis (coming soon!)
- Apply machine learning models for sentiment classification (optional)
- Share business insights and recommendations

## Step 1: Data Preprocessing
In this step, we cleaned the dataset by removing null values, converting text to lowercase, and removing irrelevant columns like `ProductId` and `ProfileName`.

### Data Cleaning Code:
| df = df[['ProductId', 'UserId', 'Score', 'Time', 'Summary', 'Text', 
         'HelpfulnessNumerator', 'HelpfulnessDenominator']]         |
